1. Application Rating: What would you score the applicant out of ten for this Job Spec {!$Input:Application.RecordType.Id}? if they dont meet the non negotiables  {!$Input:Application.Job_Spec__r.Non_Negotiables__c}, then give them a 0
2. Overview of Candidate: Give a short overview of the Candidate highlighting the number of years experience, overview of their job history, and anything else that would make this a good candidate for the role, but also where they would be lacking  
3. What makes applicant a good fit (for this specific job spec)
