1. AI Grounding RTF Flow: Component Overview and Execution Order
Type: Auto-launched Flow (triggered by Data Cloud data changes)
1. Trigger/Event
Triggered when: A new record is created in the AiGroundingFileRefCustom__dlm object, via a Data Cloud data change event.
2. Record Lookup
Step: Get_Candidate
What it does: Looks up a Candidate__c record where CV_Title__c equals the Name__c of the triggering record (AiGroundingFileRefCustom__dlm). It retrieves the first matching record.
3. Action Call: Search CV
Step: Search_CV
What it does: Calls the Apex Invocable action Agentforce_Recruitment_Agent_Invokable with the action type generateAiAgentResponse.
Parameter: Sends a prompt (generated from the candidate's email) asking to "bring up my CV my email address is {email}".
Purpose: Likely interacts with an AI agent to locate and analyze the candidate's CV based on their email address.
4. Action Call: Update Record
Step: Update_Record
What it does: Calls the same Apex Invocable action, passing along the sessionId from the previous step and a prompt "Please update my record".
Purpose: Instructs the AI agent to update the candidate record, possibly with new information extracted from the CV.
5. Flow Variables & Templates
Formulas/Text Templates: Used to dynamically compose prompts and messages for the AI agent (e.g., extracting the candidate's email, formatting requests).
Session Management: The flow passes a sessionId between steps to maintain context with the AI agent.


2. CV Analysis Prompt (Agentforce genAIFunction)
1. Trigger and Invocation
The flow (AI Grounding RTF) triggers the Agentforce action, invoking the genAIFunction named CV_Analysis_Prompt.
2. Prompt Template and Function
Prompt Template: CV_Analysis_Prompt.genAiPromptTemplate-meta.xml
This template instructs the AI to analyze a candidate’s CV in detail, categorizing data into sections (qualifications, experience, education, skills, languages, etc.).
It uses the candidate’s email (from the flow) to search and retrieve the relevant CV via Salesforce Einstein’s retriever.
The AI is instructed to present the entire CV (not just a summary) and only generate a short overview in its own words.
Function Metadata: CV_Analysis_Prompt.genAiFunction-meta.xml
Describes the function’s purpose: to extract and categorize all relevant CV data for later population in a Candidate record.
The function is invoked as generatePromptResponse and does not require confirmation or a progress indicator.
3. Input and Output Schema
Input: Expects a string input representing the CV library (i.e., an email or identifier to locate the CV).
Output: Returns the full prompt response (the CV as found plus a generated overview) and any citations from the retrieval process.
4. Plugin and Orchestration
Plugin: Candidate_CV_Search.genAiPlugin-meta.xml
Orchestrates when and how the CV Analysis Prompt is used in conversation.
Ensures the candidate’s email is used to fetch the correct CV document.
Directs the agent to bring up the entire CV and then prompt to update the candidate’s profile.
5. What It Does in the Flow
After a Data Cloud-triggered event, the system:
Looks up the candidate using the email or another identifier.
Invokes the CV Analysis Prompt genAIFunction.
The AI fetches the CV, analyzes it, and returns structured information and a short overview.
This response can then be used to update the Salesforce Candidate record automatically or after user confirmation.


In essence:
The CV Analysis Prompt genAIFunction is a core AI-driven automation step, extracting comprehensive candidate data from CVs and feeding it into your ATS flows for further processing and record updates—all orchestrated through metadata-driven configuration in Salesforce.


3. Candidate Record Update Agent Action (genAIFunction)
Purpose
This agent action is responsible for updating the Salesforce Candidate__c record with all relevant data parsed from the candidate's CV, using information extracted by the previous AI analysis steps.
How it Works
1. Plugin Orchestration
The Candidate_Record_Update plugin defines the process:
Find the correct Candidate__c record using email or record ID.
Use the AI-extracted information from the CV (from the Candidate CV Search/Prompt actions).
Confirm with the user (candidate or recruiter) if they want to update the profile.
If confirmed, proceed to update the record.
2. genAIFunction Execution
The main function (e.g., Update_Candidate_3 or Update_Candidate) is invoked, typically by a flow or agent.
The function:
Accepts the Candidate record ID and CV-derived data as input.
Populates all relevant Candidate fields with extracted CV values.
Key fields updated include: Name, Email, Address, Phone, Career Title, Career Goals, Certifications, Skills, Languages, Work History/Professional Experience, Education, Date of Birth, and Social links.
The "Summary" field is generated by the AI as a human-readable overview, starting with total years of experience.
3. Field Mapping
The AI function and flows map rich and structured data from the CV to the respective Salesforce fields:
Example fields: Career_Title__c, Seniority_Level__c, Certifications__c, Education__c, Skills__c, Work_History__c, Languages__c, Summary__c, etc.
Follows strict instructions to only use CV data for all fields except the summary, which may be paraphrased.
4. Automation and Flows
The flows (e.g., Update_Candidate_after_qs, Update_Candidate) handle the record lookup and update steps:
Lookup Candidate by email.
Assign parsed values to each field.
Update the record in Salesforce, marking it as AI-updated if applicable.

Example of the Update Process
Agent receives command to update candidate.
Looks up Candidate__c record by email or ID.
Maps extracted CV data to fields:
Career Title, Goals, Work History, Certifications, Education, Skills, Languages, Address, Social links, DOB, etc.
AI generates a professional summary.
Saves updates to the Candidate__c record.
Optional: Confirms with the user if changes should be applied, then completes the update.

In essence:
The Candidate Record Update agent action turns all the rich, structured data extracted from the candidate’s CV into a fully-populated, up-to-date Candidate__c record in Salesforce—automatically and with minimal manual input, ensuring data accuracy and completeness for downstream ATS processes.


4. Update Application RTF Flow: Component Overview and Execution Order
Type: Auto-launched Flow (triggered by Candidate record update)
1. Trigger/Event
When: The flow is triggered when a Candidate__c record is updated and the field AI_Updated_Fields__c is set to true.
How: It uses a scheduled path to wait 1 minute after the record is updated before proceeding.
2. Record Lookups
Get Applications: Looks for the first Application__c record where Status__c is "New" and Candidate__c matches the triggering record.
Get Job Spec: Fetches the related Job_Spec__c for the application.
4. Action Calls (AI Agent Invocations)
Invoke Search CV:
Calls the AI agent with a prompt to match the candidate to the job spec.
Uses a dynamic template: "Can you match the candidate (Candidate recordID: X) to the job spec they applied for (Job Spec ID: Y)..."
Update Application:
Uses the sessionId from the previous step.
Prompts the agent: "Please update the Application record."
Prompts the agent to update the candidate record with academic transcript data.

5. Templates and Variables
Userinputtemplate: Dynamic text template used to provide context to the AI agent for matching.

In essence:
This flow automates the process of matching candidates to job specs and updating application records, leveraging AI agents for both CV/application and (for graduates) academic transcript analysis. It ensures applications are updated promptly and accurately after candidate data is enriched by AI.
